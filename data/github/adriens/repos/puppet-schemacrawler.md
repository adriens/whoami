## Overview

Module that installs [schemacrawler](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/) on 'nix like systems.


## Module Description

This module :

1. Download (by staging) the zip from [schemacrawler github releases page](https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler/releases/)
3. Unzip in the proper directory (```/opt/apps/schemacrawler/```) and create symlinks so schemcrawler is
immediatley in ```PATH```

You may want to use this module if you want to install schemacrawler in a convenient way.

For now, the only purpose of this module is to install schemacrawler.

## Setup

### Requirements

* Puppet node must have web access to download the zip from github
* Have at least Java 1.8 as [SchemaCrawler works with Java SE 8 and above](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/faq.html#supported-java), and set to alternatives.


### What schemacrawler affects

This module creates the following directories :

* ```/opt/staging/schemacrawler/```
* ```/opt/apps/schemacrawler/```
* symbolic link ```/usr/bin/schemacrawler```
* symbolic link ```/opt/schemacrawler```

This module adds (if not present) the ```graphviz``` package) so schemacrawler will be able to draw relationships graphs.
